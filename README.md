## Introduction

This Power Platform project: **JS Saga Testing** is about learning how to use Javascript for UI manipulation and data retrieval. We will learn how to retrieve data using the `Xrm` WebAPI, the query used will be Odata (there is also a FetchXML version in the docs). We will learn how to get values and data from the UI as well as manipulate UI components.

The Javascript scripts for the Power Platform project **JS Saga Testing** contain **two type** of scripts:

- The Javascript scripts used for **client-side**, it's used for manipulating the UI based on the event handlers.
- The Javascript scripts used for the **ribbon buttons**, it has similar functionality as the scripts used for client-side but it's for the ribbon button.

Each script type will have its corresponding folder and `README.md` file.
